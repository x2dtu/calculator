# Calculator
This calculator was made using react and was my first react project. I was inspired to include as many features of my scientific calculator in this react calculator and had a lot of fun working on this. Please email me at 3069391@gmail.com or comment on this project page should you have any questions about the calculator, suggestions for further improvement, or have found any bugs.

## Setup Instructions
1. First, download the source code, either by executing a `git clone https://github.com/x2dtu/calculator.git` in a terminal or downloading the project as a zip through the Github page and extracting that zip.
2. This project uses npm and node to run, so make sure to have both installed on your computer before you try to run this. <br>
In a terminal at the project directory,
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary packages.
4. Run `npm start` to start the app. Enjoy!

## Controls and Features
You can either use your mouse to click the calculator buttons or use your keyboard to type expressions. The keyboard can even be used for advanced expressions (ie. type *sqrt* to make a square root, or *sin* for sine, or *!* for a factorial, etc.). <br>
This calculator follows all the rules of PEMDAS, so you can create complex expressions with multiple groupings of parentheses without worry. There is support for trigonometric functions too like sine, cosine, and tangent, and you can choose whether or not the inputs to these functions are radians or degrees. You can either use pi or e as constants, and there are log and ln functions for your logarithmic desires. Errors like dividing by 0, negative square roots or nonpositive logarithms and many others result in detailed error messages that explain what caused the error. The calculator records all your past calculations and their answers, so if you need an old expression or answer, simply click the history button and select whichever expression or answer you want. You can even append past answers or expressions to your current calculation. You can negate any expression, take a fraction of it, or clear it all by with the clear button just like a normal calculator too. Check this project out to see some of its other features; I hope you will like it!
